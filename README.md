# jira-release-composite-action

This composite action will take release notes generated with a tool as input, parse its content and automatically create a related ticket in jira. 

It can be used to coordinate testing by creating a jira ticket.

This action will try to move all tickets which are:

- Code Review state
  - require QA -> QA state
  - require no QA -> Done state

Release tickets for a specific release will be associated to each other to better keep track of all pre releases a specific release run trough. 

For final releases (not -a, -b, -rc) it will try to find the related version in jira, and mark it as released. 

# Setup

Add it to your github actions workflow:

```hml
- name: Jira-Release
  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  uses: mikepenz/jira-release-composite-action@SHA-1
  with:
    configurationDirectory: ${{ github.workspace }}/.github/config
    projectDirectory: ${{ github.workspace }}
    cachesDirectory: ${{ github.workspace }}/cache
    releaseVersion: ${{ steps.tag_version.outputs.VERSION }}
    changeLog: ${{ steps.github_release.outputs.body }}
    jiraToken: ${{ secrets.JIRA_TOKEN }}
```
